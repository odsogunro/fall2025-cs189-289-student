    "\n",
    "## Recap: The Full Transformer Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "In part 1 of this homework, we built our own transformer end-to-end. The original transformer model architecture consists of two main parts: an encoder and a decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Encoder:** The encoder processes the input sequence (for example, a sentence). Each encoder layer applies self-attention, allowing every position in the input to attend to every other position, plus a feed-forward network. The output is a collection of contextualized embeddings, one for each token.\n",
    "* **Decoder:** The decoder is designed to generate output sequences step by step (e.g., translating a sentence or generating text). At each step, the decoder takes in all previously generated outputs and the encoder's outputs, using self-attention (with causal masking so tokens can only \"see\" earlier positions) and cross-attention layers (which let the decoder attend to the encoder's output). This setup is especially important for tasks like machine translation, where the model learns to generate output one token at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full encoder-decoder architecture is useful in applications where end-to-end translation or generation from one domain to another is needed. For instance, sequence-to-sequence tasks that involve processing a source sentence and generating a target sequence based on the source sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most modern transformer variants (like BERT, DNA BERT, and GPT) drop either the decoder or encoder to specialize in different types of tasks:\n",
    "* Encoder-only: Sequence understanding (e.g., BERT, DNA BERT)\n",
    "* Decoder-only: Sequence generation (e.g., GPT)\n",
    "\n",
    "## BERT\n",
    "The Bi-Directional Encoder Representations from Transformers is a language model invented by Google researchers in October 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Encoder-only architectures like BERT and BERT-based models (like DNA BERT) use only the encoder part of the transformer, not the decoder. The encoder stack produces contextualized embeddings for each token in the input sequence.\n",
    "* This encoder-only design is standard for models focused on sequence classification or embedding tasks, as opposed to sequence generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a \"bi-directional encoder\"?\n",
    "A bi-directional encoder in BERT means that the model processes the entire input sequence at once, considering both the left and right context for every token. Traditional language models process sequences left-to-right: when predicting the token at position $t$, the transformer's decoder only looks tat tokens from position 1 to $t-1$ (this is why we needed to use masking for decoder self-attention!). Unlike traditional language models that read text only left-to-right, BERT's encoder uses self-attention to look at all tokens simultaneously, allowing it to learn richer, context-aware representations. As a result, each token's representation is influenced by all other tokens in the sequence, both before and after it. This is crucial for the model to understand the full context of DNA or text sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tokenizers\n",
    "A **tokenizer** is a tool or algorithm used in natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning that splits raw text (or sequence data) into smaller pieces called **tokens**. These tokens are the basic units that a model uses as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Purpose: Converts raw text (or DNA sequence, etc.) into tokens that can be mapped to numerical IDs and understood by models.\n",
    "* Tokens: Can be words, subwords, characters, etc.\n",
    "* Vocabulary: Each tokenizer has a vocabulary that maps each unique token to a numerical index (token ID).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do tokenizers work?\n",
    "1. The text is split into tokens using specific rules (e.g., by spaces, punctuation, or custom logic).\n",
    "2. Each token is mapped to its corresponding ID in the vocabulary.\n",
    "3. Tokenizers can add special tokens like `[CLS]` (classification token), `[SEP]` (separator token), `[PAD]` (padding token), `[MASK]` (masking token), or `[UNK]` (token for unknown inputs) as required by the model architecture and task.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example (BERT for English):\n",
    "* Sentence: `\"I love dinosaurs\"`\n",
    "* Tokens: `[\"[CLS]\", \"I\", \"love\", \"dinosaurs\", \"[SEP]\"]`\n",
    "* Token IDs: `[101, 146, 1567, 4083, 102]` (example values)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why do tokenizers matter?\n",
    "The pretrained model expects input in the form of token IDs corresponding to its vocabulary. Mismatched tokenization can lead to unknown tokens and poor performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with pretrained transformer models like DNA BERT, you should also load the **pretrained tokenizer** that matches the model. The tokenizer is not just a text splitter---it has been trained by the researchers to convert input sequences into the correct token IDs based on the vocabulary the model expects. If you use a different tokenizer, the pretrained model may not perform as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you'll often see code tutorials from PyTorch, HuggingFace, or Kaggle load in both the pretrained model and the tokenizer:\n",
    "```\n",
    "from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel\n",
    "tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"<name_of_awesome_bert_model>\")\n",
    "model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\"<name_of_awesome_bert_model>\")\n",

    "### What is DNABERT?\n",
    "DNABERT is a deep learning model that adapts the **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** architecture for DNA sequence analysis. DNA BERT takes in k-mers (DNA sequences split into groups of $k$ letters each) and outputs an embedding for each k-mer token.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The DNABERT-6 Architecture\n",
    "DNABERT-6 uses the same architecture as the original BERT model:\n",
    "* 12 transformer encoder layers\n",
    "* 768 hidden units per layer\n",
    "* 12 attention heads\n",
    "* ~110 million parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "DNABERT-6 adapts this architecture for DNA sequence data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How is DNABERT-6 trained?\n",
    "It is pre-trained on large amounts of unlabeled genetic data using k-mer tokenization, enabling it to capture both local and long-range dependencies in DNA.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is designed to be fine-tuned for various downstream tasks, such as promoter, splice site, or transcription factor binding site prediction, often with limited labeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  How does DNABERT-6 tokenize DNA sequences?\n",
    "DNABERT-6 uses k-mer tokenization: each DNA sequence is split into overlapping substrings of length k (e.g., 6-mers for DNA_bert_6). For example, the sequence `ATGGCT` with k=3 becomes `ATG TGG GGC GCT`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DNABERT-6 tokenizer expects the input as a space-separated string of k-mers. The DNABERT-6 tokenizer may also add special tokens at the start and end of a sequence of k-mers: `[CLS]` at the start (for classification) and `[SEP]` at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example (DNABERT-6) with 3-mers:\n",
    "* Split the sequence `ATGGCT` into 3-mers: `\"ATG TGG GGC GCT\"`\n",
    "* Tokens: `[CLS], ATG, TGG, GGC, GCT, [SEP]`\n",
    "* Token IDs: `[101][1234][2345][3456][4567][102]` (example values)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the [CLS] token embedding and how is it used?\n",
    "The `[CLS]` token is a special token prepended to every input sequence by the DNA BERT Tokenizer. The `[CLS]` token's final hidden state (the encoder's output vector at position 0) is designed to represent the entire sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification tasks, the `[CLS]` embedding is typically fed into a classification layer (e.g., a linear layer) to predict the class label. This approach is explicitly described in the DNA BERT paper.\n",
    "\n",
    ">\"As illustrated in Figure 1b, for a DNA sequence, we tokenized it into a sequence of k-mers and added a special token `[CLS]` at the beginning of it (which represents the whole sequence) as well as a special token `[SEP]` at the end (which denotes the end of sequence).\"\n",
    "\n",
    ">Figure 1b caption: \"DNABERT uses tokenized k-mer sequences as input, which also contains a CLS token (a tag representing meaning of entire sentence), a SEP token (sentence separator) and MASK tokens (to represent masked k-mers in pre-training). The input passes an embedding layer and is fed to 12 Transformer blocks. The **first output among last hidden states will be used for sentence-level classification** while outputs for individual masked token used for token-level classification.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In code, if your hidden state tensor is `[batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size]`, then `hidden_state[:, 0, :]` gives you the `[CLS]` embedding for each sequence in the batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do we use BERT-based models for classification?\n",
    "Since the pretrained BERT models usually don't include a classification head by default, we can add our own layer (e.g., a linear or MLP layer) at the end of BERT-based model to make predictions using the `[CLS]` token's embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical workflow is:\n",
    "1. Tokenize and encode the sequence into a list of integer Token IDs.\n",
    "2. Pass through the model to get the hidden states.\n",
    "3. Extract the `[CLS]` embedding (`hidden_state[:, 0, :]`).\n",
    "4. Feed this embedding into your classification layer and train on your labeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the standard approach for BERT-based models in both genomics and NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What does the hidden state output of DNABERT look like?\n",
    "The model's output is a tensor of shape `[batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size]` (e.g., `[10, 512, 768]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first dimension is the batch size, the second is the number of tokens passed as the input sequence to the DNABERT model (i.e. number of k-mers, up to the model's max length), and the third is the embedding size.\n",
    "\n",
    "To classify the sequence located at `batch_idx` in our batch, we use the vectors at position `[batch_idx, 0, :]` (the `[CLS]` token embedding) as the input to the classifier."

In this homework assignment, we won't actually be using the gene family as our `class`. Rather, we want to predict what species each DNA sequence comes from, so we will create our own `target` class based on whether this DNA sequence belongs to a chimpanzee, dog, or human.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's load them in as Pandas Dataframes. We'll create a `target` column based on the species the DNA comes from to use for prediction. Ideally, when training our classifier, we want our model to see an equal proportion of all the classes. The number of sequences (rows) in each txt file is not the same, so we need to create a combined dataset with an even class distribution (i.e. same number of examples for each species). We can calculate which species has the fewest DNA sequences, sample exactly that number of DNA sequences from all three species, and concatenate them together into a combined dataframe to use for training later!\n",

    "## From K-mers to DNABERT Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through the process of turning a k-mer string into model-ready input, and explain each step and output along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Tokenizing k-mers with the DNABERT Tokenizer\n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare a k-mer string like the ones we generated with the `sequence_to_kmer` function into tokens we can pass into DNABERT, we use our tokenizer.\n",
    "* `return_tensors='pt'`: This tells the tokenizer to return PyTorch tensors instead of plain lists. This is necessary because the model expects tensor inputs.\n",
    "* `max_length=512`: Sets the maximum number of tokens in the sequence. If your sequence is longer, it will be cut off at 512 tokens. We need to set this `max_length` parameter because this is the maximum number of tokens that DNABERT was designed to handle in one forward pass.\n",
    "* `truncation=True`: Ensures that if your sequence is longer than max_length, it will be truncated (cut off) rather than causing an error\n",
    "* `padding='max_length'`: This tells the tokenizer to pad all sequences to exactly max_length tokens. If your sequence is shorter than 512 tokens, special padding tokens are added at the end so that every input is the same length. Neural network models (like DNABERT) work most efficiently when all inputs in a batch are the same size. But real-world text (or DNA) sequences can have different lengths. To process batches of sequences at the same time, we need to \"fill up\" shorter sequences so that they all have the same number of tokens as the longest sequence in the batch. Tokenizers use a special token called a padding token at the end of shorter sequences to ensure  the tokenized versions of all the sequences in a batch have the same length.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "tokens = tokenizer(kmer_string, return_tensors='pt', max_length=512, truncation=True, padding='max_length')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Understanding the Tokenizer Output\n",
    "The tokenizer returns a dictionary with several keys, but the most important are:\n",
    "* `input_ids`: The numerical IDs for each token in your input. Shape: `[batch_size, sequence_length]`(or `(1, 512)` for a single sequence).\n",
    "* `attention_mask`: A tensor of 1s and 0s indicating which tokens are real (1) and which are padding (0). The model uses the attention mask to \"mask out\" padding tokens so that it doesn't *attend* to padding tokens during processing, since the padding tokens don't actually hold useful information for us!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Passing Inputs to the Model\n",
    "To get embeddings from DNABERT, we pass both   `input_ids` and `attention_mask` to the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "outputs = model(input_ids=tokens['input_ids'], attention_mask=tokens['attention_mask'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Interpreting the Model Output\n",
    "Encoder-based transformer models from the HuggingFace Transformers library (like DNABERT-6) return a `transformers.modeling_outputs.BaseModelOutputWithPoolingAndCrossAttentions` object with several attributes. The most important for most tasks is:\n",
    "*  `last_hidden_state`: This is a tensor of shape `[batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size]` (e.g., `(1, 512, 768)`).\n",

    "BERT-based models (like BERT and DNABERT) are powerful at creating embeddings for sequences, but by default, they do not include a classification head—that is, a layer that turns those embeddings into class predictions for tasks like sequence classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "To turn those embeddings into actual predictions (for example, classifying whether a movie review is positive or negative, or predicting what species our DNA sequences come from), we need to add extra PyTorch modules for classification (usually one or more linear layers that we will train specifically for our classification task).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do we use BERT-based models for classification?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the standard workflow for fine-tuning a BERT-based model like DNABERT on your own classification problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tokenize and encode the sequence into a list of integer Token IDs\n",
    "    1. In our case, we need to convert our DNA sequence to k-mers, then use the pretrained tokenizer to turn these k-mers into a list of token IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Pass the token IDs through the BERT model to get the hidden states for each token in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Extract the `[CLS]` embedding.\n",
    "The hidden state at the `[CLS]` position (usually `hidden_state[:, 0, :]` for each sequence) is designed to “summarize” the information from the whole sequence. This contains the features we'll use for classification!\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Feed the `[CLS]` embedding into a classification layer.\n",
    "Add a trainable layer (like `nn.Linear(hidden_size, num_classes)` in PyTorch) on top of the BERT model to transform the `[CLS] embedding` into logits for our classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, we'll train our classification head on our labeled data so that it learns how to turn the embeddings our BERT encoder produces into meaningful class predictions!\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is standard for all BERT-based models, whether we're working with DNA, RNA, or text in NLP! The classifier “head” learns to map the information-rich `[CLS]` embedding to your specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backbone and Classification Heads\n",
    "In the context of models like BERT that have been adapted for classification tasks, the **backbone** refers to the main part of the neural network outputs useful embeddings/features from the original inputs.\n",
    "* Its job is to take in raw input (like a DNA sequence or a sentence), processes it through many layers, and produces a rich, high-level representation (embedding) of the input.\n",
    "* Key point: The backbone is usually pretrained on a large dataset and is good at understanding general patterns in the data, but it doesn't make final predictions for your specific task\n",
    "\n",
    "The **classification head** is the part of our adapted model specifically responsible for making predictions.\n",
    "* Its job is to take the features produced by the backbone (often the `[CLS]` token embedding) and turn them into predictions for our task.\n",
    "* Key point: The classification head is what actually makes the final decision or prediction, using the information the backbone has extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, our **backbone** is a DNABERT-6 model, and our **classification head** will be the additional linear layers we add to predict what species the DNA comes from.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** Implement a `Classifier` that combines a DNABERT as our backbone and a classification head.\n",
    "1. Define a linear layer as the model's classifier in the `__init__` method.\n",
    "2. In the `forward` method:\n",
    "    1. Pass the `input_ids` and `attention_mask` to the DNABERT backbone, and extract the DNABERT output's last hidden state.\n",
    "    2. Get the embeddings for the `CLS` token for each item in the batch.\n",
    "    3. Pass the `CLS` token embeddings to the `classifier` to produce logits.\n",
    "    4. Return the logits. Recall that we usually don't apply softmax to logits inside the model itself, because PyTorch's cross-entropy loss function will take the softmax of our logits when computing the loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "* When instantiating an `nn.Linear` layer, you will need to specify an `in_features` parameter and an `out_features` parameter. How does the number of dimensions in each embedding outputted by DNABERT relate to what the `in_features` dimension of the linear layer should be? How does the number of classes we want to make predictions for relate to what the `out_features` dimension of the linear layer should be?\n",
    "* The last hidden state of the backbone's output can be accessed with the `last_hidden_state` attribute\n",
    "* You can use slicing to access all the `CLS` embeddings for each item in the batch dimension at once. Recall that the `CLS` token's embeddings are located at the first index for every item in the batch. Here is a [helpful tutorial about slicing tensors from GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/how-to-slice-a-3d-tensor-in-pytorch/)."

    "## Question 4d: Custom DNA Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a custom DNA Dataset that will return the DNA kmers as tokenized inputs our DNABERT model can use for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that when we create our own Dataset that subclasses from PyTorch's `Dataset` parent class, we need to implement 2 methods: `__len__` returns the number of samples in the dataset, and `__getitem__` returns one sample from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might notice that we've defined a `return_targets` parameter in the init method. When we use our custom dataset for training data, we will use `return_targets` so that our dataset also returns the true target labels. But this way, we can also use our custom dataset for test sets when we won't have provided targets/labels ahead of time (like when we make predictions on test data for the Kaggle competition later on!).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:**\n",
    "1. Fill in the `__len__` method.\n",
    "2. Fill in the `__getitem__` method. In the `__getitem__` method, you should:\n",
    "    1. Get 1 k-mer (and its corresponding target label if `return_targets` is True).\n",
    "    2. Pass the k-mer into the tokenizer to get its tokens. Don't forget to specify the `return_tensors`, `max_length`, `truncation`, and `padding` parameters!\n",
    "    3. Since the tokenizer will return a batched output but `__getitem__` will return data for just a single sample, you should extract the `input_ids`from the tokenizer output and reshape it from shape `(1, 512)` into `(512)`.\n",
    "    4. Likewise, extract `attention_mask` from the tokenizer output and reshape it from `(1, 512, 512)` into `(512, 512)`.\n",
    "    5. If `return_targets` is True, cast the label into a `torch.Tensor` with `dtype=torch.long`.\n",
    "    6. Return a dictionary with the following keys: `input_ids`, `attention_mask` (and `targets` if `return_targets` is True).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "* After tokenizing, use [`squeeze(...)`](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.squeeze.html) to remove the batch dimension from the tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes about batching:**\n",
    "* When we use the DNABERT tokenizer with `return_tensors='pt'`, it returns tensors with a batch dimension, even if you only tokenize a single sequence.\n",
    "    * For example, `input_ids` will have shape `(1, max_length)` and `attention_mask` will have shape `(1, max_length, max_length)`. Notice how the first dimension, which corresponds to the batch size, has a value of 1 to represent that we tokenized just a single sequence!\n",
    "* When we use a DataLoader to create batches, it will automatically stack multiple samples from the Dataset together along a new batch dimension. If you leave the batch dimension in each sample, you'll end up with an extra, unwanted dimension (e.g., (batch_size, 1, max_length) instead of (batch_size, max_length)). So if we don't remove the batch dimension in the `__getitem__` method of our Dataset, we'll get shape mismatches during training."

    "\n",
    "**Task:** Complete the loop to train and evaluate a DNA classifier.\n",

    "\n",
    "8. Move the validation input data and targets to the device.\n",

    "* The model's output for each sample is a set of logits that tells us how confident the model is about the sample belonging to each class. More concretely, for each sample in a batch, the model outputs a vector of length equal to the number of classes (e.g., [logit_0, logit_1, logit_2] for class 0, class 1, and class 3). The highest logit in this vector corresponds to the class the model predicts for that sample.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Accuracy Calculation**\n",
    "* During each epoch, we count the total number of correct predictions the model makes for all samples in the dataset.

    "## Question 4g: Train your DNA Classifier!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** Initialize and train a DNA Classifier using the `train_dna_classifier` function and the training and validation DataLoaders.\n",
    "1. Initialize an instance of the `DNAClassifier` class we implemented in question 4c.\n",
    "2. Use [`AdamW`](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.AdamW.html) as the optimizer.\n",
    "3. Use [`CrossEntropyLoss`](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss.html) as the criterion\n",
    "4. Train your DNA Classifier for 5 epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your final training accuracy after 5 epochs should be above 0.5!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "* Recall that the `DNAClassifier` class takes in a `num_classes` parameter. In our case, we are trying to classify a DNA as either a chimpanzee, dog, or human. How many classes are we making predictions for?\n",
    "* Don't forget to pass the parameters of your DNA Classifier model into the optimizer. You can access all the parameters of any object that inherits from the `nn.Module` subclass by calling `parameters()`.\n",
    "* **Play around with what learning rate works best for your AdamW optimizer!** You can tell if your learning rate is too high or too low by observing if the training metrics printed every epoch are improving. For example, we recommend starting with learning rates in the range `1e-4` to `1e-3`, and increasing the learning rate by factors of 2x or 10x to see if it yields improved performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**\n",
    "* You may notice that the validation accuracy lags below the training accuracy. That is okay! Since we are using just a small subset of our data (only 1000 samples total!), our model might be overfitting to the training set. In practical experiments, you'll probably be using much bigger datasets, but for instructive purposes, we'll use this smaller set.\n",
    "* Make sure you are using an **accelerator** such as a **Colab GPU** to train your model! For reference, it took me (Deena) about 7 minutes to train my model on Google Colab's T4 GPU."

    "First, we'll load the UrbanSound8k dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## UrbanSound8k\n",
    "\n",
    "[UrbanSound8k Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chrisfilo/urbansound8k?select=UrbanSound8K.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "The UrbanSound8K dataset consists of 8,732 short audio clips, each lasting up to 4 seconds, collected from real-world urban environments. Every clip is labeled with one of 10 common urban sound classes, such as car horn, dog bark, siren, jackhammer, and more. The dataset also includes a csv with additional metadata about each sound file,including the sound class, the recording fold, and additional details to support supervised learning and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset follows a specific naming convention:\n",
    "Each audio file is named as\n",
    "`[fsID]-[classID]-[occurrenceID]-[sliceID].wav`\n",
    "where:\n",
    "* `fsID`: a unique identifier for the original recording,\n",
    "* `classID`: an integer representing the sound class (0 for air_conditioner, 1 for car horn, etc.),\n",
    "* `occurrenceID`: which instance of that sound in the field recording,\n",
    "* `sliceID`: identifies the particular slice within the occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `100032-3-0-0.wav` is the first slice `(0)` of the first occurrence `(0)` of the sound class `3` (which corresponds to “dog bark”) from original recording ID `100032`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, we'll only need the `classID` substring from the file names!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Cross-Validation?\n",
    "The UrbanSound8K dataset is organized into 10 separate “folds”, which are different partitions of the data. Each clip in the dataset is assigned to one of these folds (from 1 to 10), which helps support **cross-validation** experiments for more robust model evaluation. In typical practice, a few folds are used for training, and the remaining ones for validation or testing, rotating which folds are used for each split.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cross-validation** is a technique used to reliably estimate how well a machine learning model will perform on new, unseen data. Instead of training and testing our model on just one split of the data, we divide our dataset into several parts (called folds) and rotate using different folds for training and testing. This way, we get multiple performance measurements that can be averaged for a fairer estimate.\n",
    "* Suppose we have our dataset split into 10 folds (as in UrbanSound8K). In each \"round\" of cross-validation, we use 9 folds for training and 1 fold for testing. We repeat this ten times, each time with a different fold held out as your test set.\n",
    "* This ensures every example gets used once for testing and multiple times for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, we’ll only use the audio clips from fold 1. This keeps things simple, enabling faster prototyping and easier debugging as you work through the fundamentals of urban sound classification.\n",

    "## Creating Spectrograms with Torchaudio\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides being an awesome Python library for building neural networks, PyTorch also has an official audio processing library called **Torch audio** that comes with handy tools for loading, transforming, and analyzing audio data in deep learning applications. **Torchaudio** is designed to work seamlessly with PyTorch and offers GPU acceleration for audio processing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `torchaudio.transforms` module contains common audio feature extraction functions such as spectrograms. These trasnforms can convert raw waveforms into numeric represetnations suitable for neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `torchaudio.transforms.Spectrogram` transform converts a raw audio waveform (a 1D array of amplitude values) into a spectrogram. This transformation is useful because it turns sound into an image-like format, which can be processed by image-based machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spectrograms** are a 2D representation of how the frequency content of the audio changes over time.\n",
    "* The spectrograms are generated by applying the **Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)** to overlapping windows of the audio signal. The result is a matrix where:\n",
    "    * The x-axis represents time (split into small chunks called time bins)\n",
    "    * The y-axis represents frequency (split into frequency bins)\n",
    "    * The values in the matrix show the strength (amplitude) of each frequency at each time\n",
    "* The `n_fft` parameter stands for \"number of FFT points\". It controls the size of the window (in samples) used for each Fourier Transform when creating the spectrogram. In other words, it determines how many audio samples are analyzed at a time to compute the frequency content. For example, `n_fft=1024` means each window of 1024 samples is transformed to analyze its frequency content. The choice of `n_fft` is a trade-off between how precisely you want to see changes in frequency versus changes in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code:\n",
    "1. We load an audio file using `torchaudio.load`, which returns the waveform and the rate at which the audio was sampled.\n",
    "2. Some of the audio clips are stereo (meaning they have 2 audio channels). In those cases, we average the 2 chanenls into a single (mono) channel for easier processing.\n",
    "3. Then, we use the spectrogram transform to extract a spectrogram of the audio.\n",
    "4. Finally, we plot the spectrogram using `matplotlib`\n",
    "    1. Note: The raw values in the spectrogram represent the power (or energy) of each frequency at each time. However, these power values can vary by several orders of magnitude; some frequencies are much louder than others, and the differences can be huge. Taking the log of the power values is a common practice in signal processing to make the scale easier to interpret. Each step in the y-axis corresponds to doubling in power. This is why in the code, we plot `spec.log2`."

    "We will implement a custom PyTorch Dataset for audio spectrogram classification. Since our audio files that we will be using for training are stored as `.wav` files inside a folder, this dataset will load .wav audio files, convert each to a spectrogram image, and extract the class label from the file name.\n",

We will use `return_targets` when creating a training dataset for our model, but when we make test predictions on a test set, we won't have provided targets/labels to instantiate our Dataset with.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Introducing ConvNeXt\n",
    "ConvNeXt is a modern convolutional neural network architecture designed to combine the strengths of traditional CNNs with design principles inspired by Transformers. Introduced in 2022 by Liu et al. in the paper [\"A ConvNet for the 2020s\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03545), it proved that pure convolutional neural networks could still perform favorably with modern transformer-based vision models! ConvNeXt updates classical CNN components (like ResNet) with design choices inspired by Vision Transformers. It was trained on the large-scale ImageNet dataset with 1000 classes, making it a powerful backbone for image classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ConvNeXt architecture\n",
    "* **Residual connections**: Like ResNets, ConvNeXt uses skip connections to help gradients flow and enable training of very deep networks.\n",
    "* **Layer normalization**: It replaces batch normalization with layer normalization, a technique popularized by Transformers, which can improve training stability.\n",
    "* **Strided convolutions to create patches**: ConvNeXt uses a `4×4` convolution with stride 4 at the first layer to slice the input image into non-overlapping patches. This is similar to how Vision Transformers process patches of images to create patch embeddings.\n",
    "* **Large receptive fields**: At later layers, ConvNeXt uses large convolution kernels. The larger convolution kernels have larger receptive fields, allowing the model to capture global context.\n",
    "    * While Transformers rely on self-attention to model relationships between all parts of the input, ConvNeXt achieves similar global context awareness through large convolution kernels.\n",
    "* **Depthwise convolutions**: ConvNeXt replaces some regular convolutions with depthwise convolutions. Depthwise convolutions apply a separate convolutional filter for each channel. As a result, information is not mixed between channels.\n",
    "* **Inverted Bottleneck Block**: Inspired by feed-forward networks in Transformers, ConvNeXt has blocks where the channel count is increased to learn many different representations of the hidden outputs, before being shrunk back down to fewer channels.\n",
    "* **Fewer activations and norms per block**: Like Transformers, ConvNeXt simplifies blocks with fewer activations (GELU instead of ReLU) and fewer normalization layers, learning that this actually improves results.\n",
    "* **Advanced data augmentation and regularization**: ConvNeXt incorporates contemporary augmentation techniques like Mixup, CutMix, and regularization borrowed from ViTs for further improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "ConvNeXt can be seen as a bridge between CNNs and Transformers, combining the efficiency and inductive biases of convolutions with some of the design insights from Transformer models."

    "## Question 5d: Adapting ConvNeXt for Sound Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "ConvNeXt was trained on the ImageNet dataset, which has 1000 classes. As a result, the final linear layer in the ConvNeXt's classifer has an output dimension of 1000: for each training point $x_i$ in our batch, the ConvNeXt will output a 1000-dimensional vector containing the probabilities that $x_i$ belongs to each of the 1000 classes. Our spectrogram dataset has 10 classes (air conditioner, car horn, children playing, dog bark, drilling, engine idling, gun shot, jackhammer, siren, street music). So to modify the ConvNeXt for our new sound classification task, we need to replace the final classifer layer with one that has an output dimension of 10 to match the number of classes we have.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with PyTorch models like ConvNeXt, it's important to understand how modules and layers are organized and accessed:\n",
    "* Most models have named attributes for their main components. For ConvNeXt, the classifier head is stored in the `model.classifier` attribute. This is typically a `nn.Sequential` container holding several layers.\n",
    "* You can access individual layers inside a sequential module by indexing. For example, `model.classifier[-1]` gets the last layer in the classifier sequence (which is usually the final linear layer responsible for outputting class scores).\n",
    "* To get the `in_features` and `out_features` dimension of a linear layer, you can access its `.in_features` attribute.\n",
    "* Lastly, when replacing layers, you can directly assign a new layer to a position in the sequence. For instance, `model.classifier[-1] = nn.Linear(...)` replaces the last layer with a new linear layer that outputs the desired number of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** Implement `replace_final_convnext_linear_layer`, which repalces the final linear layer of the ConvNeXt's classifier module with a new linear layer that outputs the specified number of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "* Use the guidelines above to access the final linear layer of the model's classifier module. For the new linear layer we will replace the final linear layer with, what should the `in_features` parameter be and what should the `out_features` paramter be so that our model outputs the right number of class predictions?\n"

    "\n",
    "In part 1 of this homework, we trained our own models from the ground up. In modern machine learning, fine-tuning pretrained models has become a foundational technique that offers significant advantages over training models from scratch. We can leverage models that have already learned rich feature representations from massive datasets, and then adapt them efficiently to specific tasks with limited data and computational resources! Earlier, we adapted DNABERT (pretrained to encode DNA kmers) by fine-tuning it to classify DNA sequences. Now, we'll fine-tune ConvNeXt, which was trained on ImageNet-1k, for spectrogram classification.\n",

    "### A quick refresher on backbones vs. classification heads\n",
    "*  Backbone: The main part of the model that extracts features from input images (e.g., all convolutional layers).\n",

    "### Loading pretrained models in PyTorch\n",
    "PyTorch makes it easy to load pretrained models for computer vision tasks. For example, you can load ResNet50 with pretrained weights using:\n",

    ">from torchvision.models import resnet50, ResNet50_Weights\n",
    ">\n",
    "> # Pretrained on ImageNet\n",
    "> model = resnet50(weights=ResNet50_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V2)\n",

    "### Fine-tuning paradigms\n",
    "When adapting a pretrained model to a new task, you have several options:\n",

    "* Load the model with randomly initailized weights by specifying`weights=None`.\n",
    "* The model learns everything from your dataset, but may require more data and training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Pretrained Weights with Frozen Backbone:\n",
    "* Load the model with pretrained weights.\n",
    "* \"Freeze\" the backbone by setting `requires_grad=False` for its parameters. This tells PyTorch not to track gradients for any weights in the backbone. When we perform the optimizer step after backpropagation, none of the backbone's weights will get updated. Only the classification head is trainable.\n",
    "* The backbone acts as a fixed feature extractor; only the head adapts to your new classes.\n",
    "* Useful when you have limited data or want to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Pretrained Weights with All Layers Trainable (Full Fine-tuning):\n",
    "* Load the model with pretrained weights.\n",
    "* All layers (backbone and head) are trainable (all their parameters have `requires_grad=True`).\n",
    "* The model can adapt all its features to your new dataset, often leading to better performance if you have enough data. Even though we are updating all the weights in the model during training, our model can train faster or reach better metrics faster becuase the backbone already has some feature extraction ability, even if it was previously pretrained on a totally different dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Freeze/Unfreeze Layers\n",
    "You can iterate through the parameters in a model using either `parameters` or `named_parameters`.\n",

    ">```python\n",

    ">        param.requires_grad = False\n",

    "3. Ensure all layers are trainable. By default, all parameters in the model have `requires_grad=True`, but to be safe, loop through all the parameters again and explicitly set them to be trainable.\n",

    "    1. Play around with different learning rates to find the best learning rate! Track if the training metrics being printed every epoch are improving meaningfully to see if your learning rate is appropriate. We recommend starting with a learning rate in the range `1e-4` to `1e-3`, and modifying the learning rate by factors of 2x (e.g. to `2e-4`, then `4e-4`) or 10x (e.g. to `1e-5` or `1e-3`) to see if it yields improved performance.\n",
